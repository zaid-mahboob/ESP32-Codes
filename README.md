ESP32 Projects
This repository contains all projects developed using ESP32 microcontroller.

## Project 1: Controlling LED Brightness Using Potentiometer
In this project, an ESP32 is connected to an LED and a potentiometer. The potentiometer acts as an analog input to the ESP32, allowing users to control the LED's brightness by adjusting the potentiometer's knob. The analog value read from the potentiometer is mapped to the LED's PWM output, providing smooth and continuous brightness control.

## Project 2: Webserver - Controlling LED using Wi-Fi
In this project, the ESP32 creates a web server that enables users to control an LED over a Wi-Fi network. Users can access a web page hosted by the ESP32, where a simple interface allows them to toggle the LED ON and OFF remotely. This project showcases the ESP32's capability to act as a web server and interact with connected devices through a browser-based interface.

## Project 3: Data Logging on Google Sheets
In this project, the ESP32 is configured to log data from the potentiometer, along with the date and time, to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. The ESP32 connects to the internet using Wi-Fi and utilizes Google Sheets API to push the analog values and timestamps to a specified Google Sheets document. This functionality is valuable for monitoring and analyzing the potentiometer readings over time.

Feel free to explore each project's folder for detailed instructions and Arduino code to replicate and experiment with these ESP32 projects.Happy hacking!
